## Start-up
To start-up the project some preliminar operations are required. Because the API will have auth in it with JWT, and is required to sign the JWT with a secret is foundamental, the secret can be generated by running the following command from the shell ```$ openssl rand -hex 32```.

This value must then be added to the environement variables ```$ export SECRET_KEY='the-string-obtained-with-openssl'```

A second environement variable is required, the path containing all the directories for with configurations, to do so run ```$ export CONFIGS_DIR='/absolute/path/to/project/root/configs```

Now that the environement variable has been set is possible to start the server with ```$ uvicorn src.main:app --reload```
